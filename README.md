# Javascript 
Day 1 – Learning the Basics
On Day 1, I focused on understanding the fundamental concepts of programming. I started with writing my first “Hello, World!” program, which helped me understand the basic structure of a program and how code is executed.

Next, I learned how to declare variables and understood why variables are important for storing and manipulating data in a program. I also studied the different types of data, such as numbers and other basic data formats, and how they are used in programming.

In addition, I practised data type operations, including: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus (remainder) and Power (exponentiation)

By the end of Day 1, I gained a clear understanding of how variables and data types work and how to perform basic arithmetic operations using them. This day helped build a strong foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts in the future.

On Day 2 of learning JavaScript, I focused on understanding comparison operators, strings, and data types. I learned how different comparison operators work, including the difference between loose and strict comparison, and why strict comparison is preferred to avoid type coercion issues. I explored strings, their creation, and common string methods used to manipulate text. I also summarized JavaScript data types by distinguishing between primitive and non-primitive types, understanding how primitives are stored by value while non-primitives are stored by reference. Overall, this day helped me build a strong foundation in how JavaScript handles data and comparisons.

On Day 3 of learning JavaScript, I focused on understanding Dates and Times. I learned how to create custom dates and times using the "Date" object and explored different methods related to handling date and time in JavaScript. Along with that, I started learning the basics of arrays. I practiced creating arrays and worked with important array methods such as "push()" and "pop()", concatenating arrays using "concat()", slicing arrays with "slice()", modifying arrays using "splice()", and converting strings into arrays. This helped me build a strong foundation in handling and manipulating data efficiently in JavaScript.
