Day 1 – Learning the Basics
On Day 1, I focused on understanding the fundamental concepts of programming. I started with writing my first “Hello, World!” program, which helped me understand the basic structure of a program and how code is executed.

Next, I learned how to declare variables and understood why variables are important for storing and manipulating data in a program. I also studied the different types of data, such as numbers and other basic data formats, and how they are used in programming.

In addition, I practised data type operations, including: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus (remainder) and Power (exponentiation)

By the end of Day 1, I gained a clear understanding of how variables and data types work and how to perform basic arithmetic operations using them. This day helped build a strong foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts in the future.
